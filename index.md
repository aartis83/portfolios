### Featured Projects

[Retail Analytics (Power BI, Python)](https://aartisrinivasan.notion.site/aartisrinivasan/Portfolio-Aarti-Srinivasan-64c565db984046238e163f63fd4a3bc7?p=7278eae1f9624dd391fc1d411b898971&pm=c)
- The analysis of the Adventure Works dataset revealed that the product categories generating the highest revenue are accessories, bikes, and clothing, amounting to a total of $23.6 million.
- Online sales have experienced significant growth, with a 15% increase in revenue over the past year, resulting in a total of $5.8 million in sales.
- The Pacific region stands out as the most profitable customer segment, contributing $6.2 million in revenue, followed by the South Atlantic and Mountain regions.
- A notable insight from the analysis is that the marketing campaign centered around product discounts has had limited effectiveness, as discounted products account for only 7% of the total revenue. Exploring alternative marketing strategies may yield better results in driving sales.
